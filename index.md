**EU_citizens_satisfaction**
This projects uses data retrieved from Eurostat to categorize European countries based on selected economic and social measures and to examine the factors influencing the level of perceived life satisfaction. I used k-means and Ward's clustering to seperate clusters and regression to estimate how selected variables explained the life satisfaction.

**AI_prediction**
As part of my master's study on AI development I forecasted number of notable machine learning models made between 2003 and 2023 in USA, European Union and China. The analysis contained various models, but only ARIMA, Holt and regression yielded sensible results for such short period.
